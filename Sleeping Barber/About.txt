The problem involves a barber shop with:

A barber.
A barber chair.
A waiting area with a limited number of chairs for customers.
The rules:

If there are no customers, the barber sleeps.
When a customer arrives:
If the barber is asleep, the customer wakes the barber.
If the barber is cutting hair, and there are empty chairs in the waiting area, the customer waits.
If the waiting area is full, the customer leaves.
Only one customer can sit in the barber's chair at a time.
When the barber finishes cutting a customer's hair, the next waiting customer (if any) is served.
